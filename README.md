Public Holidays from >40 countries, 2019-2020

It has been almost 4 years since my last time actually coding with Python. The last time I code
was about final project and research internship assignments. During these "inter-regnum" period (2016-2019),
in my bank job, I mostly code in R for data analytic purposes.

But as I am approaching learning Data Science materials, here come again the momentum to apply my Python skills.
Initially it might take a while to re-familiarize yourself with Python as your go-to tool at some time in the past,
but luckily, it has been a smooth process.

In ANY job, deadline management is crucial. But speaking from my experience in a bank job, keeping track of public holiday
calendar can be a big thing: your on-schedule payments DO affect your reputations, GREATLY.

Now, as my bank job closely deals with logistics, international payments and trade issues, no wonder we have TONS
of holidays we must keep track of, in order to ensure smooth service delivery and of course, keeping your name straight.

Besides Indonesia as my default locale, there are other banks or financial institutions across at least 46 countries worldwide 
as partners, so we do have to be aware of AT LEAST 47 countries' holidays for 2 years in a row.

This program will try to extract the ENTIRE public holidays across the list of 47 countries of concern, from 2019-2020, and
save the holidays into one giant calendar file. Just like the ones you often get from banks. But this time, you can view it
on your desktop, mobile or laptop/tablets. 

Luckily, Google Calendar have now provided us with the list of holidays per country, and all we need to do first is download them,
manually. For scraping Google Calendar web, I'll put that into next project improvements.
